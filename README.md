# Fun-with-Image
Fun with Image is a CSS/HTML + JS based Project for beginners where you get to play with Sizing, Blur-ness and background color of an image using Slider Buttons. 
The project uses basic concepts of JavaScript by getting values through Id, query Selectors and styling through JS variables.
It's my first JS project. Hope you Enjoy :)
